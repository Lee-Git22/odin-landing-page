# odin-landing-page
A landing page template design created from the ground up using html and css. A reference design was provided through the odin project. 

Some thoughts after I finished the webpage replicating the design from odin; overall quite happy and satisfied with how it is structured and how it looks. 
I mostly used flexbox methods which allowed for quick and dirty alignments of each section of the page. 
Still, there are many imperfections of the site that was made apparent when I shrunk the site to be very narrow (almost like a mobile layout) and so there is definitely more fine tuning I could do to improve the webpage's robustness. 
Another detail I could implement would be the links and buttons - in the future I will revisit this project and do that (perhaps with some javascript too).
